# hello-world

Hi my name is Ajak and this is the start of my official coding journey to be a software engineer.
I'm from Sudan and I moved to Buffalo, NY with my family in 2000. Graduated from UB with a biology
degree intending to be a doctor. Found out that was not the path meant for me. Started researching
different careers and found out about the tech industry - in particular - web development. I've been
dabbling in some Udemy courses and youtube courses to get a good understanding of HTML/CSS. I'm really
enjoying this process and I hope to continue under flatiron school and start my career as a software
engineer.
